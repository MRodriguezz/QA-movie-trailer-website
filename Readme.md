##Instructions movie trailer website
####This simple python program generates the HTML for a "movie guide" app. The design is terrible as no database is used but rather each movie is hand-coded and instantiated from the Movie class. Then a simple function generates the HTML for a webpage, using a list of movie instances. Finally the program opens a web browser with the freshly generated HTML, allowing the user to look at movie trailers.  

###What's Included

###media.py
####This file defines the Movie class, providing the constructor and a simple function to show a trailer.

###entertainment_center.py
####This file contains the details of the movies, generates the instances of Movie, and then calls fresh_tomatoes to generate and open the HTML file.

###fresh_tomatoes.py
####This file is provided by Udacity, and was not editted for the project. It contains the code to generate the HTML headers and then opens a browser to display it. 

###fresh_tomatoes.html
####This is just a sample of the output generated by the program. It is overwritten with each run of the program.
